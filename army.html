                    The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the 
                    Indian Armed Forces. The President of India serves as the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and it
                    is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star General. Two officers have been 
                    conferred the rank of Field marshal, a Five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. 
                    The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British 
                    Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states, which finally became the national army after independence.
                    units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of battles and 
                    campaigns across the world, earning a large number of battle and theatre honours before and after Independence.

                    The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and unity, defending the nation from external 
                    aggression and threats, and maintaining peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue 
                    operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, like Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned
                    by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power alongside the Indian Navy 
                    and the Indian Air Force. The army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. 
                    Other major operations undertaken by the army include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot and Operation Cactus. 
                    Apart from conflicts, the army has conducted large peace time exercises like Operation Brasstacks and Exercise 
                    Shoorveer, and it has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions 
                    including the ones in Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, 
                    Mozambique and Somalia.</p>
